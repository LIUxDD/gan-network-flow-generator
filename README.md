# GAN Network Flow Generator

This is an implementation of a generator for flow-based network traffic using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that was proposed by Ring et al., 2019<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>. The implementation is written in Python and uses the [Tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org) machine learning framework.

This is project is still pretty much work in Progress.
